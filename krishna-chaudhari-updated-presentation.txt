==========================================
SLIDE 3: DATA DISTRIBUTION ANALYSIS
==========================================

TITLE: Data Distribution Analysis

CONTENT:
Raw Data Characteristics (Based on 1500 Sample Subset):
â€¢ X1 (Fixed Acidity): Range 4.6-15.9 g/L, Right-skewed distribution
â€¢ X2 (Volatile Acidity): Range 0.08-1.1 g/L, Right-skewed distribution
â€¢ X3 (Residual Sugar): Range 0.6-65.8 g/L, Highly right-skewed
â€¢ X4 (Free SO2): Range 2-289 mg/L, Right-skewed distribution
â€¢ X5 (Total SO2): Range 9-440 mg/L, Right-skewed distribution
â€¢ X6 (Alcohol): Range 8.0-14.2%, Near-normal distribution
â€¢ Y (Quality): Discrete scores 3-9, Mean around 5.8

Key Insight: Most variables show right-skewed distributions, indicating transformation is necessary.

DESIGN NOTES:
- Add small distribution charts for each variable
- Use color coding: red for skewed, green for normal
- Include a summary table of ranges
- Show the actual sample size (1500) used

==========================================
SLIDE 4: VARIABLE SELECTION & TRANSFORMATIONS
==========================================

TITLE: Variable Selection & Transformations

CONTENT:
Selected Variables for Analysis:
â€¢ X1 (Fixed Acidity): Log transformation (reduces skewness)
â€¢ X2 (Volatile Acidity): Square root transformation (reduces skewness)
â€¢ X3 (Residual Sugar): Log(x+1) transformation (handles exponential distribution)
â€¢ X6 (Alcohol): Power transformation p=0.5 (reduces skewness)

Rationale: These variables show stronger relationships with quality and benefit most from transformation.

Transformation Applied:
- All variables normalized to [0,1] range using min-max scaling
- Quality variable (Y) also normalized for consistency

DESIGN NOTES:
- Create a 2x2 grid layout for the 4 variables
- Add transformation symbols (log, âˆš, log(x+1), x^0.5)
- Use arrows to show before â†’ after transformation
- Show the normalization formula: (x - min)/(max - min)

==========================================
SLIDE 5: TRANSFORMATION RESULTS
==========================================

TITLE: Transformation Results

CONTENT:
Data Processing Summary:
â€¢ Original dataset: 4,897 samples
â€¢ Subset used: 1,500 samples (random sampling with seed 223751702)
â€¢ Variables transformed: 4 selected + 1 quality variable
â€¢ All variables normalized to [0,1] range

Transformation Effects:
â€¢ Fixed Acidity: Log transformation reduces extreme values
â€¢ Volatile Acidity: Square root reduces skewness
â€¢ Residual Sugar: Log(x+1) handles exponential distribution
â€¢ Alcohol: Power 0.5 maintains interpretability
â€¢ Quality: Normalized for model compatibility

DESIGN NOTES:
- Create a comparison table with "Before" and "After" columns
- Use color coding: red for high skewness, green for low
- Add the normalization formula: (x - min)/(max - min)
- Show the actual seed value used (223751702)

==========================================
SLIDE 8: VARIABLE IMPORTANCE ANALYSIS
==========================================

TITLE: Variable Importance Analysis

CONTENT:
Why These Variables Matter (Based on Actual Weights):

1. **Alcohol (X6) - 47.1% weight** - MOST IMPORTANT:
   â€¢ Higher alcohol often indicates better fermentation
   â€¢ Correlates strongly with wine body and complexity
   â€¢ Most critical factor for quality prediction

2. **Residual Sugar (X3) - 35.8% weight** - SECOND MOST IMPORTANT:
   â€¢ Affects wine sweetness and balance
   â€¢ Critical for white wine character
   â€¢ Strong relationship with quality

3. **Fixed Acidity (X1) - 17.1% weight** - MODERATE IMPORTANCE:
   â€¢ Provides structure and freshness
   â€¢ Essential for wine stability
   â€¢ Contributes to overall balance

4. **Volatile Acidity (X2) - 0% weight** - NO IMPACT:
   â€¢ Shows minimal impact on quality prediction
   â€¢ May indicate data redundancy
   â€¢ Could be excluded from future models

DESIGN NOTES:
- Use a hierarchical layout with numbered points
- Add icons for each variable type
- Use color coding for weight percentages
- Include small wine-related images
- Emphasize the actual weight percentages

==========================================
SLIDE 9: BEST FITTING MODEL
==========================================

TITLE: Best Fitting Model

CONTENT:
**Power Mean p=2 (Quadratic Mean) is the Best Model** - ACTUAL RESULTS:

Evidence:
â€¢ **Lowest RMSE**: 0.140 (vs 0.141-0.150 for others)
â€¢ **Lowest Average Absolute Error**: 0.109 (vs 0.110-0.118)
â€¢ **High Correlation**: 0.400 Pearson, 0.410 Spearman
â€¢ **Balanced Weight Distribution**: More even spread across variables

Why it works best: Power mean p=2 emphasizes larger values, suitable for quality prediction where higher values indicate better quality.

**Model Ranking**:
1. ðŸ¥‡ Power Mean p=2 (RMSE: 0.140)
2. ðŸ¥ˆ WAM (RMSE: 0.141)
3. ðŸ¥‰ Power Mean p=0.5 (RMSE: 0.144)
4. OWA (RMSE: 0.150)

DESIGN NOTES:

==========================================
SLIDE 10: PREDICTION RESULTS
==========================================

TITLE: Prediction Results

CONTENT:
Input Values (Given in Assignment):
â€¢ X1 = 6.7 (Fixed Acidity)
â€¢ X2 = 0.18 (Volatile Acidity)
â€¢ X3 = 4.7 (Residual Sugar)
â€¢ X4 = 57 (Free SO2)
â€¢ X5 = 161 (Total SO2)
â€¢ X6 = 10.5 (Alcohol)

**Predicted Quality: 6/10** (Based on WAM model)

Reasonableness Assessment: This prediction is reasonable because:
â€¢ Moderate acidity (6.7) is typical for white wines
â€¢ Low volatile acidity (0.18) is good
â€¢ Moderate sugar (4.7) provides balance
â€¢ Good alcohol content (10.5%) indicates proper fermentation

**Note**: Using WAM model as it's the second-best performing model and provides stable predictions.

DESIGN NOTES:
- Create an input â†’ transformation â†’ prediction workflow
- Highlight the final prediction (6/10) prominently
- Use checkmarks for reasonable aspects
- Add a quality scale visual (1-10)
- Show the transformation process

==========================================
SLIDE 11: OPTIMAL CONDITIONS FOR HIGH QUALITY
==========================================

   - Higher fermentation quality
   - Better wine body and complexity

2. **Residual Sugar (X3)**: 2-5 g/L (35.8% importance)
   - Balanced sweetness
   - Critical for white wine character

3. **Fixed Acidity (X1)**: 6-8 g/L (17.1% importance)
   - Proper structure and freshness
   - Essential for wine stability

4. **Volatile Acidity (X2)**: <0.3 g/L (0% importance)
   - Minimal defects
   - No impact on quality prediction

**Target Quality Range**: 7-9/10
**Key Insight**: Focus on alcohol content and residual sugar for best results.

DESIGN NOTES:

==========================================
SLIDE 12: MODEL LIMITATIONS & IMPLICATIONS
==========================================

TITLE: Model Limitations & Implications

CONTENT:
Limitations of the Fitting Model:

1. **Linear Assumption**: Assumes linear relationships between variables
2. **Sample Size**: 1500 samples may not capture all wine varieties
3. **Geographic Bias**: Data from Portugal only
4. **Quality Scale**: Subjective quality ratings (3-9 scale)
5. **Variable Selection**: Only 4 out of 6 variables used

Implications:
â€¢ Model works well for Portuguese white wines
â€¢ May not generalize to other regions/varieties
â€¢ Quality predictions are estimates, not absolute measures
â€¢ Focus should be on alcohol and sugar content

**Data Processing Note**: Used student ID (223751702) as random seed for reproducibility.

DESIGN NOTES:
- Use a "caution" theme with warning colors
- Create a limitations vs. implications table
- Add icons for each limitation type
